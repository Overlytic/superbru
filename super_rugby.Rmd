This is just a very quick analysis to at least marginally improve my first superbru choices by a tiny bit.

The source of the data is: 
[Super Rugby 2009 to 2016](http://www.aussportsbetting.com/data/historical-super-rugby-results-and-odds-data/)

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

raw_df <- read_excel("super_rugby.xlsx", sheet = 1,col_names = TRUE, skip = 1)

scores <- transmute(raw_df,
                          date = Date,
                          home_team = `Home Team`,
                          away_team = `Away Team`, 
                          home_score = `Home Score`, 
                          away_score = `Away Score`,
                          Delta = home_score - away_score
)

g <- ggplot(scores) +
      geom_bar(aes(x = Delta, fill = home_team))

p <- ggplotly(g)


#MUST PUT IN Rprofile
Sys.setenv("plotly_username" = "Overlytic")
Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key" = "zCADR9ItLBnSkw8rTd06")


# Create a shareable link to your chart
# Set up API credentials: https://plot.ly/r/getting-started
chart_link = plotly_POST(p, filename = "superbru-1")
chart_link

```
